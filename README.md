Yet Another Instagram -- UI project with TypeScript &amp; Angular 2


## Steps to checkout project and run it locally
1. Clone the repository on your local machine (see Clone or Download on repo).
2. Install NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/en/), the version recommended for most users, not the latest.
3. In project folder (where you cloned it) open a command prompt and run `npm install`.
4. Install Atom (https://atom.io/).
5. In Atom, install package `atom-typescript` and `atom-beautify` (Ctrl+Shift+P > type Install Package > select Install Packages And Themes > search for packages to install).
6. Open folder where the project was checked out in Atom.
7. Open command prompt in project folder and type `npm start`. Shortly, a browser tab will open with the application.


## Common-sense rules
* For any enhancements or fixes for the code, please create a separate branch and make a pull request after the modifications are made and tested.
* The branch for development is, of course, `develop`.


## Notes
* The project uses **lite server**. This means all the changes in your static files, after save, are immediately visible in browser.
